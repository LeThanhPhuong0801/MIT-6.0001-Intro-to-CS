# MIT-6.0001-Intro-to-CS
These are the codes I wrote for the free course from MIT opencoursewave. The assigments can be found here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/assignments/
The codes are written in python 3. There is a total of 6 problem sets. The first one is straight forward. Please like and subscribe if you find this repository helpful. Thank you!
